# Artifree

**Open artifacts. Any agent.**

An independently written workspace for agent-made apps, documents, slides,
dashboards, designs, and motion. The goal is to run it on your own machine or
server and use it from a browser, CLI, HTTP API, or MCP-capable agent.

**Current stage: early development.** One vertical slice works: HTML
file-package artifacts are created, saved as immutable revisions with conflict
detection and safe retries, and previewed in a sandbox on a separate origin —
through the HTTP API, the CLI, and the web workspace, stored in a local SQLite
file. It is single-user and listens on loopback. Publishing, sharing, MCP,
the runtime SDK bridge, build and conversion workers, and multi-user
authentication are not implemented. The module inventory shown by the UI and
CLI is a build-time snapshot, not live server health.

## Quick start

Requirements: Node.js 22.12 or newer, npm 10 or newer, and rustup. The repository
pins its tested Rust toolchain in `rust-toolchain.toml`.

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
cargo run -p artifree-server -- serve --data-dir .artifree/data
```

The server prints one JSON readiness line with the API URL (default
`http://127.0.0.1:7410`), the preview origin (`http://127.0.0.1:7411`), and the
token file. Keep it running and, in another terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite and paste the token from
`.artifree/data/access-token`. Vite forwards `/v1` to the API
(`ARTIFREE_API_URL` overrides the target). Agents and scripts use the CLI:

```sh
export ARTIFREE_TOKEN_FILE=.artifree/data/access-token
node apps/cli/dist/main.js artifact create --title "Demo" --dir ./site
node apps/cli/dist/main.js artifact save <id> --base 1 --put index.html=./site/index.html
node apps/cli/dist/main.js artifact preview <id>
node apps/cli/dist/main.js artifact --help
```

Results are JSON on stdout; failures go to stderr with exit code 1 (API) or 2
(usage). A save names its base revision and fails with `revision_conflict` if
another save won. Retrying with the same `--idempotency-key` returns the
original result instead of committing twice. The HTTP API is summarized in the
[architecture document](docs/architecture.md#http-api-v1).

## Architecture

| Layer          | Location                                                     | Choice                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Presentation   | `apps/web`, `apps/cli`, `packages/runtime-sdk`               | TypeScript; web uses React/Vite, Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui with Base UI |
| Logic          | `crates/artifree-core`, `artifree-domain`, `artifree-server` | Rust; Axum on Tokio for HTTP                                            |
| Provider       | `crates/artifree-ports`, `artifree-providers`                | Rust; local SQLite storage, other adapters and workers undecided        |
| Wire contracts | `crates/artifree-contracts`, `packages/contracts`            | Rust DTOs → JSON Schema → generated TypeScript                          |

The application core depends on domain types and outbound ports. Concrete
providers implement those ports and are wired by the server composition root.
Inbound HTTP and MCP adapters will call the same application commands.

See the [architecture document](docs/architecture.md), the interactive Korean
[HTML design](docs/architecture.html), and the decision records
([0001](docs/decisions/0001-foundation.md),
[0002](docs/decisions/0002-ui-and-quality.md),
[0003](docs/decisions/0003-local-html-artifact-slice.md)).
Download `docs/architecture.html` and open it in a browser; it is standalone and
loads no external resources. Its TypeScript source is in `docs/architecture/`.

## Verification

```sh
npm run check
npm run build
npx --no-install playwright install chromium firefox
npm run test:smoke
```

Checks cover zero-warning code/design/CSS lint, strict TypeScript including
dependency declarations, generated-contract drift and rejection, both language
dependency boundaries, actual inventory paths, Rust formatting/pedantic Clippy,
rustdoc, and behavioral tests for storage, conflicts, retries, crash recovery,
authorization, and path validation. Browser checks run the workspace against a
real server, probe the preview sandbox, and exercise keyboard and dialog focus,
light/dark accessibility, desktop/mobile layouts, and standalone HTML.
CI also checks Windows, Rust's minimum version, known dependency vulnerabilities,
licenses, and workflow syntax. See [the quality policy](docs/quality.md) and
[contributor instructions](CONTRIBUTING.md) for commands and limits.

After changing wire DTOs or the scaffold inventory:

```sh
npm run generate:contracts
npm run build
```

Both generated contracts and lockfiles are committed. There is no mandatory
database server, model account, Docker daemon, or cloud subscription; SQLite is
compiled into the server.

## Planned deployment profiles

- **Local temporary:** a process-local session and temporary files.
- **Local persistent (implemented, single user):** SQLite and a local data
  directory.
- **Self-hosted:** a Rust API, separate workers, and local or external storage.
- **Hosted web:** static UI on Vercel or another host, with a separately deployed
  Rust API and workers. Function memory is not a durable session store.

Tunnels, a VPN, and reverse proxies provide access to these deployments; they
do not replace the API, storage, authentication, or worker lifecycle.

No proprietary product bundle, decompiled source, captured account
data, cookies, private URLs, or credentials belong here. An independent
implementation does not by itself establish a formally separated clean-room
process. Artifree makes no claim of compatibility with a proprietary internal
API or of complete feature equivalence.
